## Classification Methodology

This playbook uses **AI-powered smart classification** that analyzes:
- Repository descriptions and names
- GitHub topics and tags
- Content patterns and keywords
- Development context and purpose

The classification prioritizes **methodology-focused categories**:
1. **AI Coding Frameworks** - Core development frameworks and methodologies
2. **Workflow & Automation** - Development workflows and automation tools
3. **Context Engineering** - Context management and optimization techniques
